        <h2>Why is Water and Sanitation Important?</h2>
        <p>Access to clean water and proper sanitation is fundamental for health and well-being. It prevents waterborne diseases, supports hygiene practices, and promotes a healthy environment.</p>
        
        <h2>Health Risks of Lack of Sanitation</h2>
        <p>Inadequate sanitation can lead to serious health risks, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased transmission of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid.</li>
            <li>Malnutrition due to waterborne diseases affecting nutrient absorption.</li>
            <li>Environmental pollution affecting both human health and ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to Promote Better Health and Sanitation</h2>
        <p>To improve health and sanitation, consider the following practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure access to clean drinking water and proper waste disposal facilities.</li>
            <li>Practice regular handwashing with soap, especially before meals and after using the toilet.</li>
            <li>Educate communities about hygiene and sanitation practices.</li>
            <li>Support local initiatives aimed at improving water quality and sanitation infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h2>
        <p>The United Nations has established 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address global challenges, including those related to water and sanitation. Key goals include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</strong> - Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being</strong> - Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, which includes access to clean water and sanitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong> - Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, emphasizing the importance of sanitation infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Achieving these goals requires global partnerships, innovative solutions, and community involvement to ensure that everyone has access to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities.</p>
